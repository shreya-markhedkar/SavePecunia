# SavePecunia
## About Our Project 
SavePecunia is an interactive game aimed to teach financial responsibility. Pecunia, which means money in Latin, is attacked by the Demon King Prodigal and his Army. It is up to you, Parcos, to save Pecunia by defeating the Demon King.
SavePecunia is a board game, simple to understand and easy to play. Real concepts, such as Money, Experience and Happiness have been inculcated into the project to teach the player on how to make responsible and sensible financial decisions. As the player, Parcus, goes along the path of the game, he faces many challenges, which are opportunities alike, to gain experience, Aureus coins (money) and happiness points. Of course, there are also activities that when indulged in, Parcus experiences loss in points of either experience, Aureus and/or happiness. Parcus can decide whether he wants to indulge in these activities or not.
The objective of the game is to take the right decisions with the situation at hand, and have a plan for future turmoil. Parcus wins the game if he has sufficient experience, Aureus and happiness, and loses if either one of the parameters are not satisfied.
## Inspiration
We built our project based on the problem statement provided by Fifth Third Bank. Our goal is to teach financial responsibility, one that awards good money habits to all age groups
## What it does
We have built an interactive board game, providing the player with an exciting path along which they must make decisions best suited to their situation
## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS and JS to build the board game and the website.
## Challenges we ran into
The development of the idea behind the board game and path taken by the player, along with developing the logic and appropriate values of tokens at each grid square was definitely a challenge. We also brainstormed on how to make the player think responsibly and sensibly while playing the game. Moreover, we pushed all boundaries and took learning to a new level while creating the game and the website.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our game teaches strong ideals of responsibility, stability and planning for the future. The whole idea of using an interactive game to inculcate such ideals is something we definitely brag about. Finally, we are proud of the amount of effort and time we have put into SavePecunia.
## What we learned
Through the course of the hackathon, we developed and ideated a board game from scratch. We learned how powerful and endless languages such as HTML, CSS and JS can be with appropriate use of them. Teamwork, time management and creativity are some non-technical skills that we learned.
## What's next for SavePecunia
1) Multiplayer mode in which multiple players can compete against one another to see who comes out with the highest score.
2) More, larger and longer game modes with higher stakes in each mode; tougher and more complicated situations where one has to do the absolute right thing to win!
